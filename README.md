# Assistants GPT

Create and manage Open AI assistants. 

## Introduction

I am sharing the prototype as I decided to pursue other opportunities.
The objective was to create a SaaS platform for companies needing "Custom GPTs". 
The prototype is made in a way that easily allows white-labeling. 

Feel free to use the code the way you want ü§ù


## Repo presentation

1. Backend: Coded in Python. Uses Fast API. The database is PostgreSQL and all the queries are written in SQL.
2. Frontend: Vite JS.

- To initialize and clear the DB: admin_initdb.py and admin_cleardb.py
- The Fast API routes are in app.py. The classes are in app_classes.py
- All the functions to manage Open AI assistants are in ast_base.py and ast_main.py
- All db functions are in ast_db_base.py and ast_db.py
- Configurations and Support functions are in the modules called config.py and utilities.py
